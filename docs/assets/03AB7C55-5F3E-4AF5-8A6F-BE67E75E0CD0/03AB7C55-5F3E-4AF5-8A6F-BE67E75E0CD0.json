This observation could be codified as the “selection inference uncertainty principle” — one cannot simultaneously infer both the site and the branch subject to diversifying selection. In this manuscript [MEME], we describe how to infer the location of sites, pooling information over branches; previously [aBSREL] we have outlined a complementary approach to find selected branches by pooling information over sites.
